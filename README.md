# K-Nearest-Neighbor-classifier
This is a project for UCR CS170 Introduction to AI. This program uses cross validation and the nearest neighbor algorithm to determine the best features to classify samples. The features can be searched for using forwards selection search or backwards elimination search. The program takes in input from the user which is either 0 or 1 to determine whether to use forwards selection search or backwards elimination search.
